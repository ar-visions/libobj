# Silver Programming Language

Welcome to the Silver programming language project, a new initiative that aims to take the power and flexibility of C++ to the next level while simplifying its syntax and making it more intuitive and user-friendly. We are setting out to create a language that makes it easier to write efficient, reliable, and maintainable code.

Roadmap!

## Transpilation
C++17 output is likely for now; but C99 is end goal
However you will see a language that uses modules to define and allow for code generation in C99 from an efficient component lifecycle as outputted from silver language module.  
I want it to be as reflective and mulable as silver actually is.  Also conductive.  Its not the best but it will be pretty conductive.

## Design Features in Works

The main features we envision for Silver are:

### Function Uniformity
Functions in Silver should behave the same way everywhere, regardless of their context. This standardization of behavior will simplify the language, making it more understandable and user-friendly.

### Improved Template System
Silver aims to have an enhanced template system. We're learning from the challenges and successes of C++ templates, but our goal is to create a system that is more intuitive to use and provides better compile-time error messages.

### Powerful Macro System
In Silver, macros will have the capacity to generate code that can be inspected by the compiler. This feature is inspired by Lisp macros, but will be adapted to work with C++-like syntax, making it easier to create and modify complex code structures at compile time.

### Enhanced Generic Programming
Silver is designed to support powerful and flexible generic programming. While we draw inspiration from C++, our aim is to make generic programming simpler and safer in Silver.

### Integrated Metaprogramming
Metaprogramming capabilities will be an integral part of Silver. Instead of being added as an afterthought, these capabilities will be designed into the language from the start.

### Optimized Allocation in Functions
Silver will provide a way to define functions that can optimize their memory allocation behavior, allowing for increased performance and efficiency.

### Unique Static Inside Functions
The language will allow for the definition of unique statics inside functions that are generated per call. This will create more opportunities for optimization, making your programs run faster and use resources more efficiently.
