import the third party libraries. also import silver modules too.


# im not so sure about the arg because it prevents us from passing our own fields in a orthogonal way
# we have the functions load in this .o global; imports must be compiled seperately in silver (makes sense to allow each their own global)

# <- if no string arg is given to import it may still know the top module importing
module zlib {
	# this is less tokens
	import as i {
		name: 'zlib' # import would use zlib if undefined, since thats the module def name at top
		deps: [c_lib, another] # run these in this order so it knows how to build them
		src:  'https://zlib.org/repo'
	}

	void func() {

		# isolated no-op functions that do not call themselves would have to be warned about
